Hello! I'm the creator of the onisatori platform. 
Whatever becomes of onisatori but anyways, I'm an aspiring developer in hopes of creating a future career out of this.

I have experience with html and css with a couple of css frameworks such as bootstrap and tailwind.

Learning javascript, python, c++, and java.

my static site is www.onisatori.com and if you'd like to leave any feedback on how I can improve my site.
Please contact me at madeira@onisatori.com which is my main email for personal messages.

Thanks for stopping by!
